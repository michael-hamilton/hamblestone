My personal website

## Details
This site was built from scratch with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

## Usage
To run locally, clone the repo, run `npm install`, then `npm start` to spin up the Parcel server.

## Modifications
Pages are defined in the `/pages` directory as `.pug` files.  Header, Nav, Footer and global Layout templates exist in `/templates`.  Styles are compiled from site.scss in `/sass`.

More details on my file/directory scheme and how to modify it coming soon.
