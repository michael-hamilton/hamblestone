My personal website.

## Usage
To run locally: clone the repo, run `npm install`, then `npm start` to spin up a development server (likely at http://localhost:1234).
Alternatively, `npm build` will bundle the site and output into `/dist`.

## Modifications
Pages are defined in the `/pages` directory as `.pug` files.  Header, Nav, Footer and global Layout templates exist in `/templates`.  Styles are compiled from site.scss in `/sass`.

More details on my file/directory scheme and how to modify it coming soon.
